I hope I’m not too late to say this HUHU BUT WAHH
HAPPY 14TH BIDEUUUUUUU <33
There’s so much I wish I could say, but honestly, I don’t think words will ever be enough and If I tried to write down everything in my heart, this message might never END LOL.
( LONG MESSAGE AHEAD SORRY POE IF OA 😭😭 )
– ✉️
I still clearly remember the time we first met it was during lockdown. Life felt really weird asf and heavy back then. I was spending most of my days alone, slowly growing distant from my irl friends because of personal shits. I wasn’t sure how to handle things, and everything felt overwhelming for me at that time. It was easier to be online, where I didn’t have to deal with as much pressure from others ㅠㅠ.
I remember my mom would always scold me for being on my device too much LOL. She’d say things like, “Mag-aral ka muna nak, wag puro laro” 😭. But honestly? I’m glad na matigas ulo ko that time. Because if I listened to her, I probably wouldn’t have met you heh. And yk meeting you became one of the best things that happened to me during that whole time.
You were the first person who made me feel like myself and I could talk to you comfortably without pretending yk. Like, I’m not confident of opening up to people but somehow, with you, I ended up yapping about my whole shit (I’m sorry for that must’ve been so tiring) 💀. I probably sounded all over the place, but you still listened. You stayed. And that kind of kindness of yours is really stuck with me fr:,).
Over time, I met a lot of people online and at school. Some stayed for a while, others disappeared. And I always wondered if maybe I was too awkward, too clingy, or too annoying. But somehow, you stayed. You’ve always been there, even in quiet ways. That means more to me than I can say heh.
You’ve comforted me in ways I didn’t even know I needed. Through simple chats, little checkinz, funny convoz, and even just being around. You made me feel like I was enough that just being me was okay. And not many people made me feel that way before.
And of course, I’ll never forget all the things we used to do together like playing games almost 24/7😭, defending each other, gossiping about stuff, and just having fun. I’m really happy that even now, we still get to do things together, like watching/waiting for comebacks, screaming over updates, fangirling over our faves, and getting to watch enha together 🥹.
I also want to say this, even if it’s kinda awkward to bring it up 👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺
I’ve always felt a sosososo sorry for the time I confessed to you AHH I was so out of my mind.. Back then, I didn’t really understand my own feelings. I just knew I cared about you deeply 🙏🏻. I couldn’t tell the difference between liking someone romantically or loving someone platonically. But now I do. And I know what I felt was the kind of love you have for someone who made a real place in your heart. You were a friend I truly, truly treasured and still do.
Sometimes I still ask myself how our friendship lasted this long. And then I remember it’s because you stayed too. Even when things were quiet. Even when we both get busy. Even when we changed.
Now you’re 14. And it’s not just something to celebrate because you’re a year older it’s something to be thankful for, because someone like you is in this world. Someone kind hearted, trustworthy, loyal, and supportive. Someone I’m lucky to know frfr :,))).
Lastly, I just want to say that I’m really, really proud of you. You’ve come so far!! I hope today, you feel so loved. I hope you know how much you matter. And I hope you keep being the amazing person that you are. GOD BLESS!
– I REALLY ENJOY YOUR COMPANY and I’M SORRY THAT I’M BAD AT EXPRESSING MY EMOTIONS SOMETIMES BUT YOU GENUINELY MEAN A LOT TO ME. ILYSM. HAPPY BIRTHDAY AGAIN<33.
